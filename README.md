# VisitorLogger
Visitor LogBook is designed to keep track of visitors and vendors entering your facility. The system will allow the person sitting on the Helpdesk/reception to log details of visitors. The details of the visitors will be logged using HTML form and the input fields will be such as name, Contact details, whom to meet, apartment number, the purpose of meeting, date and time.
